# Better Critical Review

## Overview

**Better Critical Review** is a web application designed to allow Brown University students to leave reviews for any class at Brown. This project was developed in collaboration with three teammates, utilizing real course data scraped from the Courses@Brown website. The platform aims to provide students with a resource to share and access detailed feedback about courses and professors, helping them make informed decisions during course selection.

## Key Features
- **Course Reviews:** Students can leave detailed reviews for any class at Brown, including feedback on professors and course structure.
- **Search Functionality:** A robust search algorithm enables students to quickly find courses and professors by name, department, or other criteria.
- **Real-Time Data:** Reviews and course information are dynamically updated using Firebase integration.
- **User Interaction:** Features like karma scores and average review data provide a comprehensive view of course feedback.

## My Contributions
I collaborated with a teammate to:
1. **Scrape Course and Professor Data:** Extracted course and professor information from the Courses@Brown website to create a comprehensive course database.
2. **Database Integration:** Implemented Firebase to store and update course and review data, ensuring seamless real-time interactions.
3. **Search Algorithms:** Designed and developed the logic for efficient and accurate course search functionality.

Additionally, I was solely responsible for:
- **Handlers Implementation:** Developed specific backend handlers to manage user requests and interactions.
- **Firebase Integration:** Integrated Firebase with both the frontend and backend to handle data storage and retrieval for:
  - Storing and displaying all reviews associated with a course.
  - Updating logic for features such as karma scores and the display of average review statistics.
- **Logic Enhancements:** Implemented functionality to dynamically update review-related data, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React.js, with Clerk for auth
- **Backend (including web scraping):** Java
- **Database:** Firebase

## Collaboration and Learning
This project provided me with valuable experience in:
- Collaborating within a team to tackle complex challenges.
- Applying web scraping techniques to collect large datasets.
- Working with Firebase to integrate real-time database functionalities.
- Enhancing search algorithms and implementing dynamic logic to improve user experience.
